Check robot location using the AprilTags. 
  Case 1: Left tag (as seen by the driver)
    Place pre-loaded game piece on the corresponding scoring position. 
      Using the AprilTags to check position, move to the appropriate scoring position. 
      Raise the arm, maneuver the arm to be over the correct scoring position (again, using the AprilTags for position), and set down the game piece to score it.  
    Move to center of field and pick up a second game piece. 
      Move to the center of the field, where there are more game pieces placed down. 
      Use the AprilTags to locate the position of the leftmost game piece, and move to it. 
      Pick up that game piece. 
    Move back to scoring area and score the second game piece. 
      Move back to the leftmost scoring area. 
      Using the AprilTags to check position, move to the appropriate scoring position. 
      Raise the arm, maneuver the arm to be over the correct scoring position (again, using the AprilTags for position), and set down the game piece to score it. 
    Move to the left side of the charge station and balance it. 
      Using the AprilTags for positioning, move right until directly in front of the charge station (the left side, specifically). 
      Move forward slowly until balanced on the station. 
        Potentially use the angle of the camera to the ground to detect if balanced or not.
        Maybe also use a second, downward facing camera to see if balanced (lights turn on when balanced). 
      If unbalanced, adjust position until it is balanced again. 
  Case 2: Center tag (as seen by the driver)
    Place pre-loaded game piece on the corresponding scoring position. 
      Using the AprilTags to check position, move to the appropriate scoring position. 
      Raise the arm, maneuver the arm to be over the correct scoring position (again, using the AprilTags for position), and set down the game piece to score it.  
    Move to center of field and pick up a second game piece. 
      Move to the center of the field, where there are more game pieces placed down. 
      Use the AprilTags to locate the position of one of the center game pieces (either left center or right center), and move to it. 
      Pick up that game piece. 
    Move back to scoring area and score the second game piece. 
      Move back to the center scoring area. 
      Using the AprilTags to check position, move to the appropriate scoring position. 
      Raise the arm, maneuver the arm to be over the correct scoring position (again, using the AprilTags for position), and set down the game piece to score it. 
    Move to the center of the charge station and balance it. 
      Using the AprilTags for positioning, adjust until in front of center of charge station. 
      Move forward slowly until balanced on the station. 
        Potentially use the angle of the camera to the ground to detect if balanced or not.
        Maybe also use a second, downward facing camera to see if balanced (lights turn on when balanced). 
  Case 3: Right tag (as seen by the driver)
    Place pre-loaded game piece on the corresponding scoring position. 
      Using the AprilTags to check position, move to the appropriate scoring position. 
      Raise the arm, maneuver the arm to be over the correct scoring position (again, using the AprilTags for position), and set down the game piece to score it.  
    Move to center of field and pick up a second game piece. 
      Move to the center of the field, where there are more game pieces placed down. 
      Use the AprilTags to locate the position of the rightmost game piece, and move to it. 
      Pick up that game piece. 
    Move back to scoring area and score the second game piece. 
      Move back to the rightmost scoring area. 
      Using the AprilTags to check position, move to the appropriate scoring position. 
      Raise the arm, maneuver the arm to be over the correct scoring position (again, using the AprilTags for position), and set down the game piece to score it. 
    Move to the left side of the charge station and balance it. 
      Using the AprilTags for positioning, move left until directly in front of the charge station (the right side, specifically). 
      Move forward slowly until balanced on the station. 
        Potentially use the angle of the camera to the ground to detect if balanced or not.
        Maybe also use a second, downward facing camera to see if balanced (lights turn on when balanced).
